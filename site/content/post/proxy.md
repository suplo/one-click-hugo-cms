  WOVN Proxy is a cloud based translation proxy powered by Fastly’s global
  network. You can start localizing your website by simply routing your traffic
  through WOVN Proxy.


  WOVN Proxy is essentially a type of backend library integration. Different from traditional backends such as WOVN.php and WOVN.rb, WOVN Proxy does not run on the customers’ servers. Instead, WOVN Proxy runs on Fastly’s Compute@Edge (C@E) platform.
